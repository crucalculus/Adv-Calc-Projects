Advanced Calculus Projects
==========================

In this repository, you will find folders for each project we will work on throughout the year.

Please be sure you review the writing mathematics in paragraph style document located in the *guidelines_for_projects* folder for general information about these projects. In addition, you will find specific details for each project in their respective folders.

Each project folder has a project description document and most have some sort of template .tex file that is the starting point for your writeup. In some cases, there is also a .sagews file that can be opened in SageMathCloud to help you get started working with the project.

Some of these projects are not trivial and you may not see a solution immediately. That's ok and expected. Remember, the obstacle is the way. When you can't solve a problem, that just means you need to spend more time with. Perhaps taking breaks and letting your mind wander will actually help you solve the problem.

The one solid piece of advice I have is that you give yourself plenty of time to work on these projects.
