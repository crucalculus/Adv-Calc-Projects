# Advanced Calculus Projects
============================

## Starting Point
Please be sure you review the writing mathematics in paragraph style document located in the *guidelines_for_projects* folder for general information about these projects. In addition, you will find specific details for each project in their respective folders.

## The Folders
Each project folder has a project description document and most have some sort of template .tex file that is the starting point for your writeup. In some cases, there is also a .sagews file that can be opened in SageCloudMath to help you get started working with the project.

Most of these projects are _not_ _trivial_ and you may not see a solution immediately. That's ok and expected. Remember, the obstacle is the way. When you can't solve a problem, that just means you need to spend more time with it. Perhaps taking breaks and letting your mind wander will actually help you solve the problem.

## Feedback
I don't make the claim that these projects are perfect. If, after reading and working on a project, you have a suggestion about how to improve the project in some way, please talk with me in class or send me an email with your suggestions.

## Advice
The one solid piece of advice I have is that you must give yourself plenty of time to work on these projects. That means you begin working on the project long before the due date. Towards this end, I have scheduled one entire long period to work in class on each project.

Rushing through at the end will no doubt produce a report of mediocre quality.
