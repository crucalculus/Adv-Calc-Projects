\begin{report}
This is the report for Project 2. You will replace this text with the text of your report.

You will need to include graphs, as they are an important part of the report. The sage worksheet reminds you how to generate and save graphs as PDF documents.

The line below is what pulls the PDF graph into this document.

Please notice the command that specifies the width. You can set this to any dimension you like. I have it set for a width of 10cm. As you work on your report, you will want to change this width to make your graph look appropriately sized.

Please keep in mind that you can also change how the graph looks in the sage worksheet by changing the domain (x,-2,2) to something else. In fact, that will probably be what you need to do in order to show multiple iterations of the root-finding process.
