\newthought{It will happen} at some point during the year that you will not know how to solve a problem. How you react to this situation plays a huge role in your success at learning.

Here are some tips that will help you with learning SageMathCloud and \LaTeX.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Start working on the projects as soon as you can.
  \item Learn a little of the Python programming language by going to codeacademy.com and working through their Python tutorial.
  \item Experiment and try new things. This requires time, so be sure you have plenty of it.
  \item Use Google. Start your search with either sage or latex and follow it by a question you have. Read the results.
  \item Use StackExchange. This website can be extremely helpful with solving \LaTeX\; and Python problems.
\end{enumerate}
